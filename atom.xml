to use as possible. Analyzing molecular dynamics is hard enough, so there's
no reason that the software should get in your way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, all of the the MSMBuilder commands are separate scripts that are
installed into your path, which means that you need to remember all of the
commands. If you forget -- &lt;em&gt;wait, what is the name of the script for computing
implied timescales?&lt;/em&gt; - you'll have to go back to the tutorial and check.
That's a pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most command line utilities let you access all their different utilities from
subcommands: think &lt;code&gt;git pull&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;svn checkout&lt;/code&gt;. For MSMBuilder3, we're going
to put everything under &lt;code&gt;msmb&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One immediate UX improvement is the the ability to have a help text directly
on the root &lt;code&gt;msmb -h&lt;/code&gt; command.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="msmbuilder"></category><category term="msmbuilder3"></category></entry></feed>
